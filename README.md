Assignment 1 for CSCI 2110 (Computer Science 3 / Data Structures).

Sample output (work in progress):
<pre>Minimum coconuts required for the given amount of sailors (using equation)
0 sailors requre at-least 1 coconuts.
1 sailors requre at-least -1 coconuts.
2 sailors requre at-least 7 coconuts.
3 sailors requre at-least 79 coconuts.
4 sailors requre at-least 1021 coconuts.
5 sailors requre at-least 15621 coconuts.
6 sailors requre at-least 279931 coconuts.
7 sailors requre at-least 5764795 coconuts.
8 sailors requre at-least 134217721 coconuts.
9 sailors requre at-least 3486784393 coconuts.
10 sailors requre at-least 99999999991 coconuts.
11 sailors requre at-least 3138428376711 coconuts.
12 sailors requre at-least 106993205379061 coconuts.
13 sailors requre at-least 3937376385699277 coconuts.
14 sailors requre at-least 155568095557812211 coconuts.
15 sailors requre at-least 6568408355712890866 coconuts.

Minimum coconuts required for the given amount of sailors (using recursive method repeatedly)
0 sailors requre at-least 1 coconuts.
1 sailors requre at-least -1 coconuts.
2 sailors requre at-least 7 coconuts.
3 sailors requre at-least 79 coconuts.
4 sailors requre at-least 1021 coconuts.
5 sailors requre at-least 15621 coconuts.
6 sailors requre at-least 279931 coconuts.
7 sailors requre at-least 5764795 coconuts.
8 sailors requre at-least 134217721 coconuts.

FAILURE!!! 5 sailors and 1021 coconuts is not valid!</pre>
